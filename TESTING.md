## Bugs

### Resolved Bugs

#### Categories not working properly.

* When I made a blogpost in a category and pressed on the category to see the posts in that category I got the error message "this category doesn't exist". This was because when creating categories I spelled them with capital letters while the code was looking for the url with lower case letters. I solved this by changing the name of the categories to lower letters.

#### User name not showing in blog posts.

* When creating a new blog post as a normal user their name didn't appear on the homepage after the category name. This was because when creating a normal user I only specified their first name and not last name. I changed the code to: post.author.get_full_name to solve this issue.

### Unresolved Bug

* There are no unresolved bugs.
